An open-source investing workspace.
A bull, a bear and a critic challenge your ideas.
Then you make the call.

## Why Squabble?

Most portfolio trackers show numbers. Squabble argues about them.

- **AI research reports.** A bull and a bear debate your holdings. A critic removes weak arguments. Your risk rules run as hard gates. The result is a 14-section report with both sides preserved.
- **AI paper trading.** A virtual account. Your AI watches markets, trades on your research signals, and sends you a push notification on every fill. Connect Claude or ChatGPT through MCP. Set per-agent spending limits and approval modes.
- **Your data stays yours.** Self-hosted. Zero telemetry. Only a username and password — no phone number, no email verification.

## Install

### Desktop app (Windows / macOS)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble/releases/latest).
2. Download the installer for your system (`.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS).
3. Run the installer. Everything is bundled — PostgreSQL, the server, and the app.

After install, Squabble opens in its own window. Your data stays on your machine.

### Web app (Docker)

You need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble.git
cd squabble
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**. Create your first account.

The database starts empty. To try a demo with fictional data, run `docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up -d --build` instead.

### From source (developers)

You need Node.js 22+ and npm 10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lueyu/squabble.git && cd squabble
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Connect your AI assistant

Squabble has a built-in MCP server. Give Claude or ChatGPT access to your paper account:

1. Open **AI Paper Trading → AI Agents → Connect Agent**.
2. Copy the MCP URL and token into your assistant's MCP settings.
3. Ask it to *"check my portfolio"* or *"buy 100 shares of NVDA"*.

Each agent gets a spending limit, a read-only or trade permission, and an approval mode. Orders can auto-fill, or wait for your tap.

*Squabble* comes from the Chinese word for trading stocks (*chao gu*), but with *chao* meaning "argue." The bull and bear have opinions. You make the call.
