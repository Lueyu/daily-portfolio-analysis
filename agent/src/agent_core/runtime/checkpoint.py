"""Append-only JSONL event log for run checkpointing.

This is the Day 3 foundation for long-run reliability (the full resume feature
lands in M3). The design is event sourcing:

  - A run never mutates stored state in place. It *appends* immutable events to
    ``<checkpoint_dir>/<run_id>.jsonl``, one JSON object per line.
  - State is reconstructed by replaying the event log from the beginning through
    a reducer (``replay``). Appending is cheap and crash-safe: if the process dies
    mid-run, everything already on disk is a valid prefix, and replaying it
    rebuilds the state reached so far.

Each event is ``{"seq": int, "type": str, "ts": float, "payload": dict}``.
