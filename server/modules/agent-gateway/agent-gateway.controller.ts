/**
 * Agent gateway controller.
 *
 * Service-to-service API consumed by the Python analysis agent under
 * `/openapi/agent-gateway`. Every route is protected by `AgentGatewayGuard`
 * (shared `x-agent-token`), not the browser `@NeedLogin()` session guard. The
 * `/openapi` prefix is exempt from the browser CSRF double-token middleware.
 *
 * This is an explicit, narrow surface: the agent can only reach the business
 * capabilities that are deliberately exposed here. Day 3 exposes a single
 * read-only capability (list holdings); more endpoints are added on demand and
 * reuse the existing owner-scoped services, so the NestJS app remains the single
 * authority for auth, ledger, risk rules and schema.
